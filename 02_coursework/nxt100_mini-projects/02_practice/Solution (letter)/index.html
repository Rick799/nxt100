        <p style="padding-bottom: 1.25rem">
          Please accept this letter and the attached resume as an indication of
          my sincere interest in the open legal assistant position at Garvey,
          Schubert & Barer that I found on CAVLink, the University of Virginia's
          job database. I graduated in December 2014 with a degree in History
          and Sociology and would like to gain experience in the legal field
          before applying to law school. While reviewing your website, I was
          pleased to see that your firm operates in a wide variety of spheres.
          The areas of your practice to which I am particularly attracted are
          the Environment & Natural Resources and Land Use & Condemnation
          sectors.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 1.25rem">
          Throughout my college career, the courses I found most interesting
          were those revolving around subjects such as law, business, and land
          use. After taking a course in Land, Law and The Environment, my
          professor took me on as an intern to work at the University's
          Institute for Environmental Negotiations. My internship included
          reading reports, analyzing data, conducting active research contacting
          persons of interest to arrange interviews, and giving reports of my
          findings. From my coursework and professional experiences, I have
          developed the researching, analytical thinking and writing skills
          necessary to be a successful legal assistant. In addition, I am aware
          of the long hours and hard work that is required of the role. I am
          ready to dedicate myself to Garvey, Schubert & Barer in much the same
          way that I committed myself to being a varsity athlete. As a member of
          the swim team, I devoted up to 30 hours a week to practices, travel
          and competition while maintaining a full course load.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 1.25rem">
          I am eager to learn from the many successful lawyers at Garvey,
          Schubert & Barer holding high peer review ratings in accordance with
          Martindale-Hubbell Legal Network. I hope that you will afford me the
          opportunity to become a member of your team
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your time and consideration. I can be reached via phone
          (865-987-2222) or email (whuffman@gmail.com).
